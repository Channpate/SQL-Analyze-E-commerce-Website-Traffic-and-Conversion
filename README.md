  ## üìå Background & Overview

  ### **Objectives:**
  This project use SQL to analyze Google Analytics data of an E-commerce website to:
  * Evaluate website performance through key metrics such as visits, pageviews, transactions, and revenue over time.
  
  * Analyze user behavior and conversion funnel.
  
  * Identify marketing and product insights by comparing performance across channels and uncovering product bundling opportunities.
  
  ### **Who is this project for:**
  * Data analysts & business analysts
  * Marketing decision-makers, team leaders

  ## üìÇ Dataset Description & Data Structure

  ### Data source
  * Source: The dataset is taken from **Google BigQuery Public Datasets**, specifically **Google Analytics 360** data.
  * Size: The dataset includes **a table for each day** (daily tables), with the table name format: `ga_sessions_YYYYMMDD`. The number of rows varies depending on the day, each row corresponding to **a session**. Each table contains hundreds of thousands to millions of rows, with more than **20 data fields**, including **nested fields**.
  * Format: The data is in **SQL table** format on BigQuery. The fields have diverse data types such as `STRING`, `INTEGER`, and `RECORD` (nested structure).
    
  ### Data Structure & Relationships
  **1. Tables Used:**
  
Each day corresponds to **a data table**, named in the format `ga_sessions_YYYYMMDD`. There is also a **temporary intraday table** named `ga_sessions_intraday_YYYYMMDD` ‚Äì but this data is usually only used for the current day and will be deleted after the daily data is completed.

 In a project, you can **query multiple tables using wildcards (`ga_sessions_*`) or use tables that represent specific days.**
  
  **2. Table Schema & Data Snapshot:**
  
  The dataset **is not split into multiple tables** with foreign key relationships as in a normal relational system. Instead, **the data is in a single table per day**, with nested fields to represent internal relationships (e.g. between sessions and detailed metrics).
  
  | Field Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| fullVisitorId | STRING | The unique visitor ID. |
| date | STRING | The date of the session in YYYYMMDD format. |
| totals | RECORD | This section contains aggregate values across the session. |
| totals.bounces | INTEGER | Total bounces (for convenience). For a bounced session, the value is 1, otherwise it is null. |
| totals.hits | INTEGER | Total number of hits within the session. |
| totals.pageviews | INTEGER | Total number of pageviews within the session. |
| totals.visits | INTEGER | The number of sessions (for convenience). This value is 1 for sessions with interaction events. The value is null if there are no interaction events in the session. |
| totals.transactions | INTEGER | Total number of ecommerce transactions within the session. |
| trafficSource.source | STRING | The source of the traffic source. Could be the name of the search engine, the referring hostname, or a value of the utm_source URL parameter. |
| hits | RECORD | This row and nested fields are populated for any and all types of hits. |
| hits.eCommerceAction | RECORD | This section contains all of the ecommerce hits that occurred during the session. This is a repeated field and has an entry for each hit that was collected. |
| hits.eCommerceAction.action_type | STRING | The action type. Click through of product lists = 1, Product detail views = 2, Add product(s) to cart = 3, Remove product(s) from cart = 4, Check out = 5, Completed purchase = 6, Refund of purchase = 7, Checkout options = 8, Unknown = 0. Usually this action type applies to all the products in a hit, with the following exception: when hits.product.isImpression = TRUE, the corresponding product is a product impression that is seen while the product action is taking place (i.e., a "product in list view"). |
| hits.product | RECORD | This row and nested fields will be populated for each hit that contains Enhanced Ecommerce PRODUCT data. |
| hits.product.productQuantity | INTEGER | The quantity of the product purchased. |
| hits.product.productRevenue | INTEGER | The revenue of the product, expressed as the value passed to Analytics multiplied by 10^6 (e.g., 2.40 would be given as 2400000). |
| hits.product.productSKU | STRING | Product SKU. |
| hits.product.v2ProductName | STRING | Product Name. |

  ## ‚öíÔ∏è Process
  ### Query 1: Analyze **total visit, pageview, transaction** for Q1/2017 (Jan,Feb,Mar) (order by month)
  #### Code:
  ``` sql
  SELECT FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m',PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) month
        , SUM(totals.visits) visits
        , SUM(totals.pageviews) pageviews
        , SUM(totals.transactions) transactions
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
  WHERE EXTRACT(month from PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) <4
  GROUP BY FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m',PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date))
  ORDER BY month ASC
  ```
  #### Result:
  | month    | visits | pageviews | transactions |
  | -------- | ------- | -------- | ------- |
  | 201701  | 64694    | 257708 | 713 |
  | 201702 | 62192     | 233373 | 733 |
  | 201703   | 69931    | 259522 | 993 |
  
  #### Observations & Findings:
  * Transactions increased steadily over Q1, with a 39% rise from January (713) to March (993), indicating improved user conversion.
  * Visits and pageviews dipped slightly in February, then peaked in March, suggesting a possible campaign or seasonal effect.
  * March was the strongest month across all key metrics, marking the best performance in the quarter.
  
  ### Query 2: Analyze bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (order by total_visit DESC)
  
  Bounce_rate = num_bounce/ total_visit
  
  #### Code:
  ``` sql
  -- calculate metrics group by source
  WITH group_by_source AS (
      SELECT trafficSource.source
        , SUM(totals.bounces) total_no_of_bounces
        , SUM(totals.visits) total_visits
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`
      GROUP BY trafficSource.source
  )
  -- round up result and sort
  SELECT *
        , ROUND(total_no_of_bounces*100.0/total_visits,3) bounce_rate
  FROM group_by_source
  ORDER BY total_visits DESC
  ```
  #### Result:
  | source    | total_no_of_bounces | total_visits | bounce_rate |
  | -------- | ------- | -------- | ------- |
  | google    | 19798    | 38400 | 51.557 |
  | (direct) | 8606     | 19891 | 43.266|
  | youtube.com   |4238    | 6351 |66.73 |
  | analytics.google.com   | 1064    | 1972 | 53.955 |
  | Partners   | 936 | 1788 | 52.349 |
  | m.facebook.com   | 430    | 669 | 64.275 |
  | google.com   | 183  | 368 | 49.728 |
  #### Observations & Findings:
  * Google and (direct) were the top traffic sources by visit volume, with 38,400 and 19,891 visits respectively, contributing the most to site traffic.
  * YouTube.com and m.facebook.com had the highest bounce rates, at 66.73% and 64.28%, indicating low user engagement from social channels.
  * Despite high traffic, Google‚Äôs bounce rate (51.56%) was moderate, suggesting a fair level of user interaction compared to other sources.
  * Referral sources like analytics.google.com and Partners had smaller traffic volumes but relatively high bounce rates (~53%), which may warrant closer examination of user intent or landing page relevance.
 
  ### Query 3: Revenue by traffic source by week, by month in June 2017
  #### Code:
  ``` sql
  -- calculate revenue by traffic source by month
  SELECT 'Month' time_type
        , FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m',PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) time
        , trafficSource.source source
        , ROUND(SUM(product.productRevenue)/1000000.0,4) revenue
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201706*`
      , UNNEST(hits) hits
      , UNNEST(hits.product) product
  WHERE product.productRevenue IS NOT NULL -- filter products that have revenue
  GROUP BY FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m',PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date))
          ,trafficSource.source
    
  UNION ALL -- merge with week data
    
  SELECT 'Week' time_type
        , FORMAT_DATE('%Y%W',PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) time
        , trafficSource.source source
        , SUM(product.productRevenue)/1000000.0 revenue
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201706*`
      , UNNEST(hits) hits
      , UNNEST(hits.product) product

  | Week      | 201726 | google              | 5,330.57    |
  | Week      | 201725 | (direct)            | 27,295.32   |
  | Week      | 201726 | (direct)            | 14,914.81   |
  | Week      | 201722 | (direct)            | 6,888.90    |
  | Week      | 201726 | dfa                 | 3,704.74    |
  | Week      | 201724 | mail.google.com     | 2,486.86    |

  #### Observations & Findings:
  * **(direct) traffic was the dominant revenue driver** in June 2017, contributing over $97,000 in the month and consistently leading weekly revenues.
  * Google and dfa were the next top-performing channels, with notable weekly spikes, especially in week 24 and 26.
  * Revenue is heavily concentrated among a few top channels, while most others (e.g., social and referral sources like YouTube, Yahoo, Facebook) contributed minimally.
  * Week 24 showed the highest revenue peak, likely driven by both direct and Google traffic.

  ## üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendations
  From the eight analytical questions run against user behavior and performance data on an e-commerce website, key findings were identified:
  
  **1. Traffic & Engagement Trends**
  * Visits, pageviews, and transactions increased steadily across Q1/2017, with March being the highlight month, reflecting solid momentum across customer engagement and purchasing behavior.
  * Direct and Google sources drove most traffic and revenue, with social and referral sources showing high bounce and low conversion rates.
  
  **2. User Behavior & Conversion Funnel**
  * Buyers looked at fewer pages than non-buyers, indicating increased goal-oriented activity in converting users.
  * The average user who made a purchase during July placed over 4 purchases and spent $43.85 per session‚Äîindicating high involvement by buyers.
  * Funnel performance increased across the months: product view ‚Üí add to cart ‚Üí buy rates all increased from January to March.
  
  **3. Product Performance**
  * Certain items, such as "Google Sunglasses," tended to be purchased in conjunction with other items, and hence offered clear cross-sell opportunities.
  
  **4. Recommendations**
  *  Invest more marketing spend in Direct and Google channels, both of which produce high traffic and revenue with good bounce rates.
  *  Address YouTube, Facebook, and other referral channel high bounce rates with landing page optimization and targeting more intentful segments.
  *  Deploy product bundles or recommendation widgets on highly co-bought products to increase average order value.
  *  Segment user behavior deeper to target marketing efforts more specifically.
